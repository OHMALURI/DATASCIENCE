This repository contains the assignments,case study articals  which were done by me.


Case Study 1: In this case study, I developed a database for a hypothetical material procurement company. 
               The database is designed to assist in material procurement management for construction projects.
               It helps track materials, suppliers, orders, inventory, and deliveries for the company.
