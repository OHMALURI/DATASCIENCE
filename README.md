This repository contains the assignments,case study articals  which were done by me.


Case Study 1:
               In this case study, I developed a database for a hypothetical material procurement company. 
               The database is designed to assist in material procurement management for Procurement Company.
               It helps track materials, suppliers, orders, inventory, and deliveries for the company.

Data driven Report on Airbnb dataset :
                                      In this case study, I utilized a real-time dataset from Airbnb 
                                      I created an interactive dashboard for executives using Power BI. 
                                      This dataset covers a one-year period (2016-2017).
                                      I developed a comprehensive data model from the dataset and leveraged Power BI to build informative dashboards. 
                                      Throughout the analysis, I uncovered valuable insights into booking trends, property preferences, and host performance.

wholesale World cloud architecture:
                                    In this project, I have designed a cloud architecture for Wholesale World, a hypothetical retail company. The architecture uses Lakehouse Architecture to efficiently manage and 
                                    analyze data, incorporating a structured pipeline design and failure strategies.
                                    You can find the full article explaining the architecture in more detail at the link below:[wholesaleWorld_cloud_architecture](https://github.com/OHMALURI/DATASCIENCE/blob/main/wholesale%20world%20article%20ohm%20000942201.pdf)
