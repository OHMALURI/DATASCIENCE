This repository contains the assignments,case study articals  which were done by me.


Case Study 1: In this case study, I developed a database for a hypothetical material procurement company. 
               The database is designed to assist in material procurement management for Procurement Company.
               It helps track materials, suppliers, orders, inventory, and deliveries for the company.

Analytical Report on Airbnb dataset : In this case study, I utilized a real-time dataset from Airbnb, a hotel/rental company,
                                      I created an interactive dashboard for executives using Power BI. 
                                      This dataset covers a one-year period (2016-2017).
                                      I developed a comprehensive data model from the dataset and leveraged Power BI to build informative dashboards. 
                                      Throughout the analysis, I uncovered valuable insights into booking trends, property preferences, and host performance.
